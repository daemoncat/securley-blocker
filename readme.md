!ALERT! this has been patched by securley, i am trying to find a different unblocker. more updates when i have found one.


Hi internet/github alike! I have found a way to disable that pestelential app Securly. Credit goes to THE-UNBLOCKER to discover this vulnrability.



(OPTIONAL) Download the video file and watch it if you want a better walkthrough.
1. go to this link and make a bookmark called "bypass": https://tinyurl.com/bettergoofcurly
2. go to this link and copy all of the code: https://spot-maze-chinchilla.glitch.me/ingot.js
3. go to a new blank tab and make a bookmark, them click more.
4. when you see the "edit bookmark" window appear, in the link that the bookmark goes to, paste all of the javascript code and name the bookmark "bypass24". make sure to delete the original link before pasting.
5. save the bookmark.
6. go back to the first link and click the "Click me" button, and then open the bookmark "bypass24" if you have done everything correctly, you should see a GUI appear.
7. click the "soft disable" button.
8. have fun with an unblocked browser (:
i hope this guide helped!
